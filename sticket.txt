23rd Oct Updates on Batch reservations

Batch Reservations:
1. Batch reservation page created (admin/trans_reservation_status)
2. Stock batch reserved based on following constraints:
      a). Batch Ready: If all orders of a transaction are having enough stock to process for batch
      b). Partial Ready: If any order of a transaction is not having requested quantity of items by a franchise then transaction is considered as partially ready
      c). Not Ready: If all orders are having zero stock  then That transaction is not at all ready for processing
3. Showing orders under transactions
