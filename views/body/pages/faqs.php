<b>For Example,</b> let's say that a product costs Rs 1000 and snapittoday.com is offering it you at Rs 800.<br> <br>
"If you choose to buy this product in quantities of 6 to 10, the offer price reduces to 650.<br>
If you choose to buy this product in quantities of 11 to 15, the offer price reduces to 550.<br>
The concept here is that you get to save more when you buy more. <br>
Now you've chosen to buy the product in quantities of 6 to 10." <br><br>
<b>Now this can be achieved in 2 ways:</b><br>
<b>Option 1:</b> Buy it yourself<br>
In order to qualify for the discount on this slot, you need to purchase the product in quantities between 6 and 10. The corresponding discount is applied to the total price before payment.<br><br>

<b>Option 2:</b> Invite Co-workers or friends
Okay so you're interested in the discount applied on slot (6 &ndash; 10) but you don't want to buy them all, just 2.
We understand.<br>
What you can do is invite your co-workers or friends from outside your work community to buy the remaining quantity within a period of 3 days.<br>
 If all the invitees accept and purchase the product within the 3 days, then everybody gets a cash back of the mentioned amount.
